## Introduction

Translating your WordPress website into multiple languages is one way to increase traffic and engage visitors from other countries. It may also be a requirement for your project.

In this guide, we’ll explore the basic concept of translations and a few plugins that get the job done.

## Multilingual Solutions

Since version 4.0, WordPress has offered language selection within the installation process. That language then becomes the one and only language of the site.

If you want to have posts, pages, and custom post types available in multiple languages, you will need a translation plugin to handle the extra functionality. Translation plugins allow you to translate the content (often by hand, manually) into numerous other languages.

Then when your users come to the site, they can pick which language to view the post in.

WordPress are planning to add support for native multilingual functionality in [phase 4 of the Gutenberg development program](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/). Until then, plugins are the current solution.

## Compatible Plugins

Luckily there’s an array of great translation plugins available for WordPress, and we’ve rounded up the top 4 along with their guides on translating custom fields with ACF.

### 1: WPML

Polylang is another powerhouse translation plugin that now boasts over 500,000 active users. A freemium plugin by nature — the ACF integration requires Polylang Pro.

While the translation process is straightforward, there is one caveat. Currently, their integration only works for posts and pages and does not work for options pages.

Although there is an additional plugin contributed by BeAPI that does translate the options pages using Polylang Pro.
